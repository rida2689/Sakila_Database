       COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
FROM category AS c

JOIN film_category AS fc
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id

JOIN film AS f
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id

JOIN inventory AS i
ON f.film_id = i.film_id

JOIN rental AS r
ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id

WHERE c.name='Animation' OR
c.name='Children' OR
c.name='Classics' OR
c.name='Comedy' OR
c.name='Family' OR
c.name='Music'

Question 3/
Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:
Category
Rental length category
Count

Answer/
WITH t1 AS (
  SELECT c.name,
         f.rental_duration,
         NTILE(4) OVER(ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS quartile
  FROM category AS c

  JOIN film_category AS fc
  ON c.category_id = fc.category_id

  JOIN film AS f
  ON f.film_id = fc.film_id

  WHERE c.name='Animation' OR
          c.name='Children' OR
          c.name='Classics' OR
          c.name='Comedy' OR
          c.name='Family' OR

SELECT t1.name,
       t1.quartile,
       COUNT(*)
FROM t1
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;


Question #2
Question 1/
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

Answer/
SELECT DATE_PART('year', r.rental_date) AS rental_year,
	   	 DATE_PART('month', r.rental_date) AS rental_month,
       CONCAT('Store ',store.store_id) AS store,
       COUNT(*)
FROM store

JOIN staff
ON store.store_id = staff.store_id

JOIN rental r
ON staff.staff_id = r.staff_id

GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 4 DESC;


Question #2
Question 2/
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?

Answer/
WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
           c.customer_id,
           p.amount,
           p.payment_date
    FROM customer AS c

    JOIN payment AS p
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id),

     t2 AS (
     SELECT t1.customer_id,
            SUM(t1.amount)
     FROM t1
     GROUP BY 1
     ORDER BY SUM(t1.amount) DESC
     LIMIT 10)

SELECT t1.full_name,
       DATE_PART('month', t1.payment_date) AS payment_month,
       DATE_PART('year', t1.payment_date) AS payment_year,
       COUNT (*),
       SUM(t1.amount)
FROM t1

JOIN t2
ON t1.customer_id = t2.customer_id

WHERE t1.payment_date BETWEEN '20070101' AND '20080101'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 5;
