# Sakila DVD Rental Database

Project completed: 17th April 2020

## Description

In this project, I used SQL to query the Sakila DVD Rental database.  

## Files used

The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, or how the stores compare in their performance.

## Questions

I answered 4 questions:

1) We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music. Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.
  
2) Provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category.
  
3) We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month.
  
4) We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?

## Credits

I would like to thank the contributors of Stack overflow. During the time of working on this project, I relied on questions and comments to correct issues.
